These are some of the personal projects I have been up to. Make sure to check them out on
[GitHub]({{site.github.owner_url}}) as well.

My writing style within the projects aims at a _simple-to-complex_ narrative.
I try to start with
the more **artistic**, easy-to-digest ideas for the general audience and I get increasingly **technical**
towards the end to also
content fellow scientists and engineers.

You can also find the icons
<i class="fas fa-palette"></i> and
<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>
as a guideline to establish the separation between art and technique, respectively.
That being said, if you think you lack the background to understand the deepest details,
feel free to jump out of the boat at any time.
